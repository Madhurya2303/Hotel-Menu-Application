# Hotel-Menu-Application
The Hotel Menu Application is a Java-based system that enables users to view and order items from a restaurant menu, specify quantities, and see a summary with the total bill. It tracks real-time stock updates and logs session details, including ordered items and remaining stock, in a text file (fileexp.txt).
